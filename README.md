Blackjack is a classic casino game where the player plays against the dealer, who has a strategy set by the house. The playerâ€™s goal is to get a sum of cards above the dealers, but not above 21. The player can achieve this using different strategies. We wish to test which of various strategies are the most profitable in the long run. 

We wish to set up a table class with a dealer and a player with a specific strategy. The strategy is defined as a function. The table class uses a game class, which plays one game which the table then uses to calculate the player's new wealth. At the table there can be played multiple games and it then sums up game results when a predetermined number of games are played. 

To compare the strategies we will visualize the accumulated wealth for each strategy, throughout the games.
